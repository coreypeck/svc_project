Step 1: 
On both the yellow and pink sheet, "have they contacted svc before?"
"is this their first contact with svc?"
"Is this their first contact with SVC?"
YES - prompt to take demographics and report them as a new person (for both yellow and pink sheets)
NO- no need to prompt for demographics

Step 2:
"Was the contact before Oct 1, 2016?"
YES - prompt for demographics
NO- nothing

Added new question to the yellow sheet. The question is:

6. Has the victim/survivor used this type of in-person service since October 1, 2016?

YES - then just consider them a contact but not a new person
NO - Consider them a new contact for that in-person service (whether it is support group, one-to-one counseling, forensic exam support, etc.

Hopefully there is a way to do this that won't duplicate numbers and conflict with the "is this their first contact with SVC?" question.

For example, a person called on the phone to make an appointment for a one-to-one counseling session. They've technically contacted us before and we would have recorded
that on a pink sheet. For the yellow sheet, we want to recognize that we've made contact with them before (is this their first contact with SVC?) but also acknowledge
whether or not this is their first time using a specific in-person service (have they used this type of service since oct 1?).
